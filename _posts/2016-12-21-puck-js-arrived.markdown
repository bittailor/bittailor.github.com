My [Puck.js](http://www.puck-js.com/) [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gfw/puckjs-the-ground-breaking-bluetooth-beacon) reward arrived. Time to go back to Bluetooth LE and start with Web Bluetooth. Also looking forward to connect my Puck.js's to a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b) trough BLE.
